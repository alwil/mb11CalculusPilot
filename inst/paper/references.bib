Among individual flavonols ranged from 0.095 to 3.264 mg gÀ1, epicatechin was the predominant flavanol accounting for 32.9\%. Contrary to catechin, epicatechin was a reliable predictive value of the polyphenol content. Conversely the percentage of theobromine used as a proxy measure for nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) was not a good predictor of epicatechin or flavanol content. In a further chiral analysis, the naturally occurring forms of cocoa flavanols, (À)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin, was determined joint the occurrence of (+)epicatechin and (À)-catechin due to the epimerization reactions produced in chocolate manufacture. (À)-Epicatechin, the most bioactive compound and predominant form accounted of 93\%. However, no positive correlation was found with\% cocoa solids, the most significant quality parameter.},

  abstract = {Background: The purpose of this review was to investigate evidence for a possible etiological association between oral health and pneumonia or other respiratory diseases. Methods: The following data sources were used: Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process \& Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily Update, and OLDMEDLINE); Cumulative Index to Nursing \& Allied Health Literature; Evidence Based Medicine of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects; EMBASE; Health and Psychosocial Instruments; HealthSTAR; International Pharmaceutical Abstracts; PubMed; and Google Scholar from the earliest record until July 2005. Studies were selected from randomized controlled clinical trials and longitudinal, cohort, case-control, and epidemiological studies. Searches were limited to English language and human studies. Results: A total of 728 articles were searched for relevancy, determined by article title, abstract, and full copy, resulting in a yield of 19 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These articles were read and scored independently by the reviewers to obtain the evidence for this review: 1) the potential risk factors for pneumonia were identified as the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, dental decay, and poor oral hygiene in five studies; 2) a weak association between periodontal disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was identified in four poor to fair studies; and 3) 10 studies were retained providing evidence that interventions aiming to improve oral health reduced the progression or occurrence of pneumonia. Conclusions: 1) There is fair evidence (II-2, grade B recommendation) of an association of pneumonia with oral health (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2 to 9.6 depending on oral health indicators). 2) There is poor evidence of a weak association (OR {$<$}2.0) between COPD and oral health (II-2/3, grade C recommendation). 3) There is good evidence (I, grade A recommendation) that improved oral hygiene and frequent professional oral health care reduces the progression or occurrence of respiratory diseases among high-risk elderly adults living in nursing homes and especially those in intensive care units (ICUs) (number needed to treat [NNT] = 2 to 16; relative risk reduction [RRR] = 34\% to 83\%).},

Increasing evidence suggests that root exudates initiate and modulate dialogue between roots and soil microbes. For example, root exudates serve as signals that initiate symbiosis with rhizobia and mycorrhizal fungi. In addition, root exudates maintain and support a highly specific diversity of microbes in the rhizosphere of a given particular plant species, thus suggesting a close evolutionary link. In this review, we focus mainly on compiling the information available on the regulation and mechanisms of root exudation processes, and provide some ideas related to the evolutionary role of root exudates in shaping soil microbial communities.},

Separation is made with a Bondesil C18 column using methanol–water–acetic acid or ethanol–water–acetic acid (20:75:5, v/v/v) as the mobile phase at 0.7 mL/min. Identification is made by absorbance detection at 273 nm. Under optimized conditions, the detection limit of the HPLC method is 0.1 pg/mL for all three methylxanthines. This method is applied to urine and to 25 different beverage samples, which included coffee, tea, chocolate, and coconut water. The concentration ranges determined in the beverages and urine are: {$<$} 0.1 pg/mL to 350 µg/mL and 3.21 µg/mL to 71.2 µg/mL for caffeine; {$<$} 0.1pg/mL to 32 µg mL and {$<$} 0.1 pg/mL to 13.2 µg/mL for theobromine; {$<$} 0.1 pg/mL to 47 µg/mL and {$<$} 0.1 pg/mL to 66.3 µg/mL for theophylline. The method proposed in this study is rapid and suitable for the simultaneous quantitation of methylxanthines in beverages and human urine samples and requires no extraction step or derivatization.},

It is based on the existing auricular surface aging method of Lovejoy et al. ([1985] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 68:15–28), but the revised technique is easier to apply, and has low levels of inter- and intraobserver error. The new method records age-related stages for different features of the auricular surface, which are then combined to provide a composite score from which an estimate of age at death is obtained. Blind tests of the method were carried out on a known-age skeletal collection from Christ Church, Spitalfields, London. These tests showed that the dispersion of age at death for a given morphological stage was large, particularly after the first decade of adult life. Statistical analysis showed that the age-related changes in auricular surface are not significantly different for males and females. The scores from the revised method have a slightly higher correlation with age than do the Suchey-Brooks pubic symphysis stages. Considering the higher survival rates of the auricular surface compared with the pubic symphysis, this method promises to be useful for biological anthropology and forensic science.

However, there is growing evidence for use of locally available wild plants from an increasing number of pre-agrarian sites, suggesting broad ecological knowledge. The extraction of chemical compounds and microfossils from dental calculus removed from ancient teeth offers an entirely new perspective on dietary reconstruction, as it provides empirical results on material that is already in the mouth. Here we present a suite of results from the multi-period Central Sudanese site of Al Khiday. We demonstrate the ingestion in both pre-agricultural and agricultural periods of Cyperus rotundus tubers. This plant is a good source of carbohydrates and has many useful medicinal and aromatic qualities, though today it is considered to be the world's most costly weed. Its ability to inhibit Streptococcus mutans may have contributed to the unexpectedly low level of caries found in the agricultural population. Other evidence extracted from the dental calculus includes smoke inhalation, dry (roasting) and wet (heating in water) cooking, a second plant possibly from the Triticaceae tribe and plant fibres suggestive of raw material preparation through chewing.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between urbanization and upper respiratory health in two early modern populations from the Netherlands. For this purpose, we analyzed the prevalence of chronic maxillary sinusitis in the adult urban population of Arnhem (n = 83) and in the rural village of Middenbeemster (n = 74). A slightly higher prevalence of chronic maxillary sinusitis was observed in the Arnhem sample (55.4\%) compared with the Middenbeemster sample (51.3\%), and these variations were not statistically significantly different. Although historical sources attest to the fact that life in the postmedieval settlements of Arnhem and Middenbeemster greatly differed, our results suggest that both environments exposed people to certain respiratory hazards. Furthermore, sinusitis prevalence was also investigated in correlation to sex, as urbanization in the Netherlands often involved women in factory work in direct contrast to the traditional domestic role they kept covering in rural environments. No significant differences were observed between males and females, both in an intersite (Arnhem males vs. Middenbeemster males; Arnhem females vs. Middenbeemster females) and in an intrasite (males vs. females at Arnhem; males vs. females at Middenbemster) comparison. As men and women in Arnhem worked on similar tasks, our results confirm that they were both exposed to similar risk factors. In Middenbeemster, where women mainly stayed inside taking care of the house while men worked the fields, the adverse weather conditions and continuous exposure to pollens and allergens may have enhanced men's chances of contracting chronic maxillary sinusitis. This study suggests that urbanization in the early modern Netherlands was in fact not inherently more detrimental than rural living. Future research incorporating a larger sample from other Dutch sites is being considered to better frame the complex etiology of sinusitis within the present understanding of historic regional variation in urbanization patterns.},

Caffeine was isolated from the teas with liquid-liquid extraction and quantitated by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. Caffeine concentrations in white, green, and black teas ranged from 14 to 61 mg per serving (6 or 8 oz) with no observable trend in caffeine concentration due to the variety of tea. The decaffeinated teas contained less than 12 mg of caffeine per serving, and caffeine was not detected in the herbal tea varieties. In most instances, the 6- and 8-oz serving sizes contained similar caffeine concentrations per ounce, but the steep-time affected the caffeine concentration of the tea. These findings indicate that most brewed teas contain less caffeine per serving than brewed coffee.},

Drug metabolites also can be detected in oral fluid. Unlike urine testing, there may be a close correspondence between drug and metabolite concentrations in oral fluid and in blood. Interpretation of oral fluid results for drugs of abuse should be an iterative process whereby one considers the test results in the context of program requirements and a broad scientific knowledge of the many factors involved in determining test outcome. This review delineates many of the chemical and metabolic processes involved in the disposition of drugs and metabolites in oral fluid that are important to the appropriate interpretation of oral fluid tests.

  abstract = {Objective The aim is to present a review of the literature on human saliva composition, flow rates and some of the health benefits of saliva, with emphasis on studies from our laboratory that have looked at effects of age and age-related diseases on saliva output and composition. Data Saliva influences oral health both through its non-specific physico-chemical properties, as well as through more specific effects. The proline-rich proteins, statherin and the histatins are salivary proteins that influence calcium phosphate chemistry, initial plaque formation and candida infection. Increases or decreases in mastication may affect saliva output. Our cross-sectional studies of saliva in a large population-based study cohort (N=1130) indicate that there is an age-related decline in saliva output for unstimulated whole, stimulated parotid, unstimulated submandibular/sublingual and stimulated submandibular/sublingual saliva, as well as some compositional alterations in anti-microbial and other proteins. Some of these alterations also appear to be specific for certain age-related medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus. Conclusions These studies and data presented confirm the importance of saliva in maintaining a healthy oral environment; the practitioner is encouraged to consider saliva output and medical conditions that may compromise it as part of routine dental treatment planning.},

  abstract = {The consumption of plant-derived hallucinogenic substances through smoking and snuffing is a long-standing tradition in the south-central Andes. Chemical and archaeobotanical evidence point to the consumption of nicotine and tryptamine alkaloids in Northwestern Argentina and of tryptamine alkaloids in San Pedro de Atacama (SPA), in prehispanic times. In this paper, results are reported of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses aimed at identifying nicotine and tryptamine alkaloids in the hair of mummies from different cultural periods of SPA. Fifty-six samples were examined. While tryptamines were not found in any of the samples, nicotine was found in 35 samples, assigned to the Late Formative (1 of 1 sample from this period), Late Formative or Middle (1 of 2 samples from either of these periods), Middle (4 of 6 samples from this period) and Late Intermediate periods (8 of 12 samples from this period), or without assignment to period due to lack of contextual information (21 of 35 samples unassigned to a period). These results show a continuous consumption of nicotine from the Late Formative to the Late Intermediate periods of SPA (ca. 100 B.C.–1450 A.D.). No associations were found between presence of nicotine in the hair of mummies and presence of snuffing trays or of other snuffing paraphernalia in the corresponding tomb; furthermore, neither the diversity of the funerary context, measured in terms of the number of types of objects, nor the presence of gemstone necklaces differed between tombs with mummies with or without nicotine in their hair. Overall, these results suggest that consumption of nicotine was performed by members of the society at large, irrespective of their social and wealth status.},

Here we show that certain alkaloids, nicotine in this case, can also be trapped and preserved in ancient dental calculus. We present Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) results of analyses of ten archaeological calculus samples from eight individuals from Central California. Two samples tested positive for the presence of nicotine, including one from an individual buried with a pipe. UPLC-MS analyses of dental calculus could provide an alternative means to trace the spread and consumption of tobacco and other plants with distinctive alkaloid products in ancient societies. As shown here for the first time in ancient samples, the ability to detect nicotine alkaloids in calculus has enormous potential to help us better understand the consumption of intoxicant plants by ancient humans on the individual level, for example by giving us the ability to test assumptions about the age, sex, and status of individual tobacco users in the past.},

Stable isotope analysis was performed on 120 humans, 41 faunal specimens and 8 charred seeds. Dental calculus analyses were carried out on 94 samples. Overall, isotope data indicated an omnivorous diet based on C3-terrestrial protein, although some individuals possessed carbon values indicative of C4 plant consumption. In terms of animal protein, the diet was probably based on cattle, sheep, pig and chicken products, as witnessed by the archaeozoological findings. Evidence from calculus suggested the consumption of C3 cereals, Fabaceae, Fagaceae, milk and dairy products. Secondary metabolites of herbs and wine were also detected. The detection of marine fish ancient DNA, as well as of ω3 fatty acids in calculus, hypothesized the consumption of marine foodstuffs for this coastal population, despite the lack of a clear marine isotopic signal and the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids in plant tissues. Moreover, the knowledge of ethnopharmacological tradition and the application of medicinal plants (e.g. Punica granatum L., Ephedra sp. L.) were also identified. The detection of artemisinin, known to have antimalarial properties, led to hypothesize the presence of malaria in the area. Altogether, the combined application of microscopy and biomolecular techniques provided an innovative reconstruction of Medieval lifeways in Central Italy.},

The degradation of neutral THC seems to occur somewhat slower. When cannabinoids were stored in extracted form at room temperature the degradation rate of acidic THC increased significantly relative to resin material with concentration halve-lives of 35 and 91 days in daylight and darkness, respectively. Once cannabis material is extracted into organic solvents, care should be taken to avoid the influence of sunlight.},

The preservation of mummified human bodies in the Azapa Valley, northern Chile, provided an opportunity to test the exact nature of the psychoactive plants used in this region. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS), here we show that ancient Andean populations from northern Chile consumed Banisteriopsis, a vine that contains harmine. This is the first direct archaeological evidence of hallucinogenic and medicinal ethnographic practices. Interestingly enough, this rainforest plant does not grow along the Atacama coast, thus our findings suggest extensive plant trade networks in antiquity as far as the Amazon.},

For most individuals, life in the Beemster centred around dairy farming and was heavily based on manual labor, with a purported higher class of wealthier individuals performing less manual labor. Two skeletal markers of activity are examined in the upper limb of late young adult and middle-aged adults of both sexes (26–49\,years, n\,=\,69): osteoarthritis (OA) and entheseal changes (EC). Results support the hypothesis that the majority of the population engaged in high levels of physical activity; however, a group with a clearly lower or different pattern of activity, possibly representing a higher, less active class, was not discernible. This may be due to a low number of less active individuals in the analysed sample and/or the heterogeneity of occupations and activities. A gendered division of labour was evident in the EC data with males having more pronounced muscle attachments in almost all sites, especially the biceps brachii, used primarily in lifting. Females had more pronounced triceps brachii, which may be due to activities that required pushing or pulling with the elbow in a flexed position. The prevalence and severity of OA did not differ between the sexes. While this could be interpreted to indicate men and women engaged in a similar level of strenuous activity, hormonal and anatomical differences limit the strength of the comparison. The second objective of this study is to evaluate the concordance of OA and EC as activity markers. The correlation between OA and EC is very low, illustrating their variable and complex etiologies. Etiological factors need further research for OA and EC to become more reliable activity markers. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

  abstract = {Background: Associations between poor oral health and chronic lung disease have recently been reported. The present study evaluated these potential associations by analyzing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III), which documents the general health and nutritional status of randomly selected United States subjects from 1988 to 1994. Methods: This cross-sectional, retrospective study of the NHANES III database included a study population of 13,792 subjects ≥20 years of age with at least 6 natural teeth. A history of bronchitis and/or emphysema was recorded from the medical questionnaire, and a dichotomized variable combined those with either chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema, together considered as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Subject lung function was estimated by calculating the ratio of forced expiratory volume (FEV) after 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC). Oral health status was assessed from the DMFS/T index (summary of cumulative caries experience), gingival bleeding, gingival recession, gingival probing depth, and periodontal attachment level. Unweighted analyses were used for initial examination of the data, and a weighted analysis was performed in a final logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender, race and ethnicity, education, income, frequency of dental visits, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and alcohol use. Results: The mean age of all subjects was 44.4 ± 17.8 years (mean ± SD): COPD = 51.2 ± 17.9 years and subjects without COPD = 43.9 ± 17.7 years. Subjects with a history of COPD had more periodontal attachment loss than subjects without COPD (1.48 ± 1.35 mm versus 1.17 ± 1.09 mm, P = 0.0001). Subjects with mean attachment loss (MAL) ≥3.0 mm had a higher risk of COPD than those having MAL {$<$}3.0 mm (odds ratio, 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 2.05). A trend was noted in that lung function appeared to diminish with increasing periodontal attachment loss. Conclusions: The findings of the present analysis support recently published reports that suggest an association between periodontal disease and COPD. J Periodontol 2001;72:50-56.},

  abstract = {An association between oral conditions such as periodontal disease and several respiratory conditions has been noted. For example, recent evidence has suggested a central role for the oral cavity in the process of respiratory infection. Oral periodontopathic bacteria can be aspirated into the lung to cause aspiration pneumonia. The teeth may also serve as a reservoir for respiratory pathogen colonization and subsequent nosocomial pneumonia. Typical respiratory pathogens have been shown to colonize the dental plaque of hospitalized intensive care and nursing home patients. Once established in the mouth, these pathogens may be aspirated into the lung to cause infection. Other epidemiologic studies have noted a relationship between poor oral hygiene or periodontal bone loss and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Several mechanisms are proposed to explain the potential role of oral bacteria in the pathogenesis of respiratory infection: 1. aspiration of oral pathogens (such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, etc.) into the lung to cause infection; 2. periodontal disease-associated enzymes in saliva may modify mucosal surfaces to promote adhesion and colonization by respiratory pathogens, which are then aspirated into the lung; 3. periodontal disease-associated enzymes may destroy salivary pellicles on pathogenic bacteria to hinder their clearance from the mucosal surface; and 4. cytokines originating from periodontal tissues may alter respiratory epithelium to promote infection by respiratory pathogens.

  abstract = {For prospective investigation of drugs and metabolites in archaeological and contemporary dental calculus, a sensitive, broadly applicable ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using pneumatically assisted electrospray ionisation (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was developed. The dental calculus was treated with citric acid and the dissolution extracts were cleaned using weak and strong polymeric cation-exchange sorbents. The method was validated on hydroxyapatite for the analysis of 67 drugs and metabolites. Typically, the lower limits of quantification were in the range of 0.01–0.05ng for the sample mass extracted. The general applicability of the method was tested using dental calculus material sampled from 10 corpses undergoing forensic autopsy. The calculus material was washed several times before dissolution to remove residual substances originating from saliva, gingival crevicular fluid and blood. The wash extracts and the calculus samples (cleaned calculus material) were analysed using the same instrumental conditions. The dry mass of the calculus samples ranged from 1 to 10mg. The total number of drug detections was 131 in the dental calculus samples and 117 in the whole blood samples. From the analyses of the wash extracts and calculus samples, it was proven that drug residues were trapped in the interior of the calculus material. In 82 of the drug detections, the drug concentrations were higher in the dental calculus than in the blood. Among substances detected in the dental calculus but not in the blood were cocaine, heroin, 6-MAM and THCA-A.},

Therefore, the effect of antioxidants on the long-term stability of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinol (CBN), cannabidiol (CBD), 11-hydroxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-OH), and 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) in whole blood samples preserved with fluoride citrate (FC) and fluoride oxalate (FX) mixtures was investigated at different temperatures. The measured concentrations of the cannabinoids in authentic whole blood preserved solely with FC or FX mixtures decreased significantly during prolonged storage at −20°C. On average, less than 5\% of the initial concentrations of THC and CBD were recovered after 19 weeks of storage interrupted by 5 thawing/freezing cycles. The rate of decrease was greatest in FC-preserved blood. The repeated thawing/freezing of the samples accelerated the instability progression. At 5°C approximately 60\% of the initial concentrations of THC and CBD were recovered after 19 weeks of storage. No significant decrease was observed in samples stored at −80°C during the test period of 5 months. The instability at −20°C was to a great extend avoided by adding 30 mM ascorbic acid (ASC) to the samples before storage. Samples preserved with a combination of the FX mixture and ASC showed no significant decrease in the recovered concentrations during a 5-month storage period interrupted by 6 thawing/freezing cycles. Samples preserved with a combination of the FC mixture and ASC showed almost similar improvements in cannabinoid stability. Other reducing agents such as sodium metabisulfite and glutathione also improved the stability in FX-preserved blood stored at −20°C.},

  abstract = {Five surveys, using a previously developed high-performance liquid chromatography procedure to measure caffeine concentrations, indicated great variations in the concentrations of caffeine in tea and coffee. In the study of beverages prepared at home, data on caffeine concentrations in 58 samples of tea and coffee, volumes of cups, and numbers of cups consumed/day, indicated that the range of caffeine intakes for the women participating was 49-1022 mg/day. There were considerable day-to-day variations in caffeine contents in coffee samples from some commercial coffee shops. When 17 samples of five national brands of instant coffee were made into beverages in the laboratory, variations in caffeine concentrations between lots were small but between brands were significant. A considerable range of caffeine concentrations was also found when 12 samples of coffee prepared at work by different individuals using the same jar of instant coffee were analysed. Analysis of tea samples prepared in the laboratory indicated that steeping time had an important influence on resulting caffeine and theobromine concentrations. People preparing their own beverages were found to drink more liquid than the volume offered commercially. The mean caffeine 'contents' of home-made coffee and of coffee prepared by individuals at work were 79.4 and 81.7mg/cup respectively, indicating a mean intake of approximately 80mg caffeine/cup. When this amount (80 mg/cup) was used to estimate daily intakes of caffeine from coffee, on the basis of the number of reported cups/day, and the values obtained were compared with the amounts actually consumed by individuals, the potential for misrepresentation of individual consumption became obvious. For example, for subjects consuming three cups of coffee, only 25\% would have been correctly categorized in the expected range for the daily intake of caffeine, 39\% would have been overestimated and 36\% underestimated for the amount of caffeine consumed. These variations in caffeine concentrations and in the volume of coffee consumed have frequently been ignored in examinations of the possible relationship between coffee consumption and various health problems, and this could perhaps partly explain some conflicting results seen in epidemiological studies.},

Method validation includes chemical characterization of a suite of smoke plants and experimental reproduction of “smoked” pipe chemistry; results indicate biomarkers are traceable for several species commonly smoked by ethnographic native peoples, including tobacco (nicotine, cotinine), tree tobacco (anabasine), and kinnikinnick (arbutin). Developed methods—where residue is extracted directly from the stone or clay matrix of whole and fragmentary archaeological pipes—may be applied in similar studies investigating the spread and use of ritual smoke plants in the ancient Americas and elsewhere.},

However, small sample sizes and limited dental health metadata have hindered health-focused investigations to date. Here, we investigate the relationship between tobacco pipe smoking and dental calculus microbiomes. Dental calculus from 75 individuals from the 19th century Middenbeemster skeletal collection (Netherlands) were analyzed by metagenomics. Demographic and dental health parameters were systematically recorded, including the presence/number of pipe notches. Comparative data sets from European populations before and after the introduction of tobacco were also analyzed. Calculus species profiles were compared with oral pathology to examine associations between microbiome community, smoking behavior, and oral health status. The Middenbeemster individuals exhibited relatively poor oral health, with a high prevalence of periodontal disease, caries, heavy calculus deposits, and antemortem tooth loss. No associations between pipe notches and dental pathologies, or microbial species composition, were found. Calculus samples before and after the introduction of tobacco showed highly similar species profiles. Observed interindividual microbiome differences were consistent with previously described variation in human populations from the Upper Paleolithic to the present. Dental calculus may not preserve microbial indicators of health and disease status as distinctly as dental plaque.},

  abstract = {Objectives Dental plaque is associated with a variety of systemic diseases and mortality risks in living populations. However, bioarchaeologists have not fully investigated the mortality risks associated with plaque (or its mineralized form, calculus) in the past. This study examines the relationship between survivorship and calculus in a medieval skeletal sample. Materials and methods Our sample (n = 1,098) from four medieval London cemeteries, c. 1000–1540 CE, includes people who died under attritional (normal) and catastrophic (famine and plague) conditions. The associations between age and the presence of dental calculus on the permanent left first mandibular molar are assessed using binary logistic regression and Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Results The regression results indicate a significant negative relationship between age and calculus presence for individuals of all ages who died under normal mortality conditions and for adults who died under both normal and catastrophic conditions. Survival analysis reveals decreased survivorship for people of all ages with calculus under normal mortality conditions. Similarly, during conditions of catastrophic mortality, adult males with calculus suffered reduced survivorship compared to males without it, though there was no difference in survivorship between adult females with and without calculus. Conclusions These results suggest that, as in modern populations, calculus accumulation in the inhabitants of medieval London reflects a greater risk of premature death. The evaluation of calculus, a potential measure of underlying frailty, in the context of a demographic measure of general health suggests that it might provide insights into health in past populations.},

  abstract = {To date, characterization of ancient oral (dental calculus) and gut (coprolite) microbiota has been primarily accomplished through a metataxonomic approach involving targeted amplification of one or more variable regions in the 16S rRNA gene. Specifically, the V3 region (E. coli 341-534) of this gene has been suggested as an excellent candidate for ancient DNA amplification and microbial community reconstruction. However, in practice this metataxonomic approach often produces highly skewed taxonomic frequency data. In this study, we use non-targeted (shotgun metagenomics) sequencing methods to better understand skewed microbial profiles observed in four ancient dental calculus specimens previously analyzed by amplicon sequencing. Through comparisons of microbial taxonomic counts from paired amplicon (V3 U341F/534R) and shotgun sequencing datasets, we demonstrate that extensive length polymorphisms in the V3 region are a consistent and major cause of differential amplification leading to taxonomic bias in ancient microbiome reconstructions based on amplicon sequencing. We conclude that systematic amplification bias confounds attempts to accurately reconstruct microbiome taxonomic profiles from 16S rRNA V3 amplicon data generated using universal primers. Because in silico analysis indicates that alternative 16S rRNA hypervariable regions will present similar challenges, we advocate for the use of a shotgun metagenomics approach in ancient microbiome reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Dental calculus is among the richest known sources of ancient DNA in the archaeological record. Although most DNA within calculus is microbial, it has been shown to contain sufficient human DNA for the targeted retrieval of whole mitochondrial genomes. Here, we explore whether calculus is also a viable substrate for whole human genome recovery using targeted enrichment techniques. Total DNA extracted from 24 paired archaeological human dentin and calculus samples was subjected to whole human genome enrichment using in‐solution hybridization capture and high‐throughput sequencing. Total DNA from calculus exceeded that of dentin in all cases, and although the proportion of human DNA was generally lower in calculus, the absolute human DNA content of calculus and dentin was not significantly different. Whole genome enrichment resulted in up to four‐fold enrichment of the human endogenous DNA content for both dentin and dental calculus libraries, albeit with some loss in complexity. Recovering more on‐target reads for the same sequencing effort generally improved the quality of downstream analyses, such as sex and ancestry estimation. For nonhuman DNA, comparison of phylum‐level microbial community structure revealed few differences between precapture and postcapture libraries, indicating that off‐target sequences in human genome‐enriched calculus libraries may still be useful for oral microbiome reconstruction. While ancient human dental calculus does contain endogenous human DNA sequences, their relative proportion is low when compared with other skeletal tissues. Whole genome enrichment can help increase the proportion of recovered human reads, but in this instance enrichment efficiency was relatively low when compared with other forms of capture. We conclude that further optimization is necessary before the method can be routinely applied to archaeological samples.},
