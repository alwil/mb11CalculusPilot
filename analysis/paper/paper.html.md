## Introduction

<!-- intro to calculus and residues -->
Dental calculus has proven to be an excellent source of a wide variety of information
about our past. The increased accessibility and advancement of methods in
aDNA, paleoproteomics, and mass spectrometry, has expanded our ability to identify
biomarkers of diet and disease on an increasingly large scale
[@warinnerEvidenceMilk2014; @velskoDentalCalculus2017; @gismondiMultidisciplinaryApproach2020].

<!-- define alkaloids -->
One such collection of biomarkers is alkaloids, a plant-derived group of compounds.
Many alkaloids
have important medicinal and psychoactive effects in humans, and their direct
detection, or detection of their metabolites, is of great interest to archaeologists.
Previous studies have successfully recovered alkaloids in archaeological
contexts, including ceramics [@smithDetectionOpium2018], pipes
[@raffertyCurrentResearch2012], human hair
[@ogaldeIdentificationPsychoactive2009; @echeverriaNicotineHair2013], and even
dental calculus employing both targeted [@eerkensDentalCalculus2018] and
untargeted approaches
[@buckleyDentalCalculus2014; @gismondiMultidisciplinaryApproach2020].
Especially nicotine, the principal alkaloid in tobacco leaves,
has been widely studied in the archaeological record due to its apparent stability
and ability to survive over long periods of time
[@eerkensDentalCalculus2018; @raffertyCurrentResearch2012; @tushinghamHuntergathererTobacco2013].

<!--how are compounds incorporated in dental calculus-->
Alkaloids may enter the oral cavity via two pathways: (1) direct
incorporation through ingestion of alkaloid-containing plants, whether
deliberate or accidental;
and (2) passive diffusion as alkaloids and other compounds are transferred from
plasma to saliva, and then gradually secreted into the oral cavity through the
salivary glands in the hours-to-days following ingestion [@coneInterpretationOral2007].
The second pathway allows the identification of parent compounds that do not enter
the mouth (e.g. injection), as long as they, or their metabolites, are excreted
through the saliva, thus eventually entering the oral cavity.

<!--cite e.g. injection or topical The second pathway may also be more
detectable, as the excretion of compounds through saliva may take hours to days
whereas compounds spend less time in the oral cavity during direct consumption.-->

Many of the components involved in the formation and growth of dental calculus
originate from oral fluid. Proteins, bacteria, salts and other compounds are
transferred from saliva to biofilms on the tooth surface
[@whiteDentalCalculus1997; @jinSupragingivalCalculus2002].
This may also allow various alkaloids of dietary and medicinal origin to become
incorporated in dental plaque. Dental plaque undergoes frequent mineralisation
events, ultimately causing the entrapped alkaloids and their metabolites to become
preserved within the dental calculus. Barring intentional or accidental removal of
the calculus during life,
burial, excavation, and post-excavation cleaning, the alkaloids can then be detected
by various methods to show a record of consumption during life.
Because drugs may be transferred from plasma to saliva,
there is often a close correlation between drugs detected in
oral fluid and blood, though there are differences in detected concentrations
[@coneInterpretationOral2007; @willeRelationshipOral2009; @milmanOralFluid2011].
This was also shown to be true for dental calculus and blood [@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021],
making dental calculus a potentially useful substance for detecting ancient
alkaloids and other dietary compounds.

<!--brief description of method validation-->
In this study we use a ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method that was developed in a previous study on dental
calculus from cadavers and validated by comparing the results to compounds detected
in the blood of the same individuals [@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021].
All compounds that were detected in the blood were also detected in dental calculus,
with additional compounds present in dental calculus that were not present
in blood, suggesting that dental calculus represents a comprehensive history of
consumption over a long period of time [@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021].
<!--summary of results-->
We were able to detect both parent compounds and metabolites, including caffeine,
nicotine, theophylline, and cotinine, in the dental calculus of individuals from
a 19th century Dutch population from Middenbeemster. By detecting these compounds
we are able to show the consumption
of tea and coffee and smoking of tobacco on an individual scale, which is also
confirmed by historic documentation and identification of pipe notches in the
dentition.



## Materials

<!-- Demographics and description of MB11 sample, selection criteria. -->
The sample consists of 41 individuals from Middenbeemster,
a 19th century rural Dutch site.
The village of Middenbeemster and the surrounding Beemsterpolder was established
in the beginning of the 17th century, when the Beemster lake was drained to
create more farmland, mainly for the cultivation of cole seeds (de Vries 1978).
In 1615, a decision was made to build a church, and
construction started in 1618 (Hakvoort 2013). The excavated cemetery is associated
with the Keyserkerk church, where the inhabitants of the Middenbeemster village
and the surrounding Beemsterpolder were buried between AD 1615 and 1866
[@lemmersMiddenbeemster2013]. Archival documents are available for those buried
between AD 1829 and 1866, when the majority of individuals were interred.
The main occupation of the inhabitants
was dairy farming, consisting largely of manual labour prior to the industrial
revolution [@aten400Jaar2012; @palmerActivityReconstruction2016].

For our sample, we preferentially selected males from the middle adult age category
(35-49 years) to minimise the effect of confounding cultural and biological factors.
Previous research on Middenbeemster has shown a gendered division of labour
[@palmerActivityReconstruction2016], and there are biological differences in
dental calculus formation and drug metabolism that are related to age and sex
[@huangDecipheringGenetic2023; @unoSexAgedependent2017; @whiteDentalCalculus1997].
The sample consists of 27 males,
11 probable males,
2 probable females, and
1 female (@fig-sample-demography).
We selected males due to a higher
occurrence of pipe notches and dental calculus deposits than females (unpublished observation).

## Methods

### Skeletal analysis

<!-- methods for age, sex, and stature estimation -->
Demographic and pathological analyses were conducted in the Laboratory for Human
Osteoarchaeology at Leiden University. Sex was estimated using cranial
and pelvic morphological traits [@Standards1994]. Age-at-death was estimated using
dental wear,
auricular and pubic surface appearance, cranial suture closure, and epiphyseal fusion 
[@Standards1994; @SucheyBrooks1990; @buckberryAuricular2002; @lovejoyAuricular1985; @meindlSutureClosure1985],
and divided into the following categories:
early young adult (18-24 years), late young adult (25-34 years), middle adult
(35-49 years), old adult (50+ years). Preservation was visually scored on a
four-stage scale (excellent, good, fair, poor) based on the surface condition of
the bones and the extent of taphonomic degradation.

#### Paleopathology

Pathological conditions and lesions that occur frequently in the population were
included in the analysis. Data were
dichotomised to presence/absence to allow for statistical analysis.
Osteoarthritis was considered present in cases where eburnation was visible
on one or more joint surfaces.
Vertebral osteophytosis is identified by marginal lipping and/or osteophyte
formation on the margin of the superior and inferior surfaces of the vertebral
body.
Cribra orbitalia was diagnosed based on the presence of pitting on the superior
surface of the orbit. No distinction was made between active or healing lesions.
Degenerative disc disease, or spondylosis, is identified as a large diffuse
depression of the
superior and/or inferior surfaces of the vertebral body [@rogersPalaeopathologyJoint2000].
Schmorl's nodes are identified as any cortical depressions on the surface of
the vertebral body.
Data on chronic maxillary sinusitis from @casnaUrbanizationRespiratory2021 were
included in this study to assess the relationship between upper respiratory
diseases with environmental factors (i.e. tobacco smoke, caffeine consumption).
Lesions associated with chronic maxillary sinusitis as defined by
@boocockMaxillarySinusitis1995 were
recorded for each individual and classified as "pitting", "spicule-type bone
formation", "remodeled spicules", or "white pitted bone".
chronic maxillary sinusitis was scored as absent
when the sinus presented smooth surfaces with little or no associated pitting.

#### Dental pathology

Caries ratios were calculated by dividing the number of lesions by the number
of teeth scored, resulting in a single caries ratio per individual. If the surface
where the lesion originated is not visible, i.e. if the lesion covered multiple
surfaces, this was scored as "crown".
Calculus indices were calculated according to Greene and colleagues [-@greeneQuantifyingCalculus2005].
Calculus was scored with a four-stage scoring system (0-3) to score absent, slight,
moderate, and heavy calculus deposits [@brothwellDiggingBones1981]
on the lingual, buccal (and labial), and interproximal surfaces of each tooth. Only
one score was used for the combined interproximal surfaces, resulting in three
scores per tooth (when surfaces are intact), and four calculus indices per individual;
upper anterior, upper posterior, lower anterior, lower posterior.
Each index was calculated by dividing
the sum of calculus scores for each surface by the total number of surfaces scored
in each quadrant. If a tooth could not be scored on all three surfaces, the tooth
was not included [@greeneQuantifyingCalculus2005].
Periodontitis was scored on a visual four-stage (0-3) scoring system according to
distance from cemento-enamel junction of each tooth to alveolar bone [@maatManualPhysical2005].

### Calculus sampling

Where possible, we used material that had already been sampled for a previous
study to prevent unnecessary repeated sampling of individuals. 
Calculus from the previous study was
sampled in a dedicated ancient DNA laboratory at the Laboratories of Molecular
Anthropology and Microbiome Research in Norman, Oklahoma, U.S.A,
using established ancient DNA protocols. More details on the methods can be found
in the published articles
[@ziesemer16SChallenges2015; @ziesemerGenomeCalculus2018]. 
Of the 41 individuals that were originally included in our sample,
29
were replicated in a separate analysis only using calculus from the previous study.  
New dental calculus samples were taken under sterile conditions in a positive
pressure laminar flow hood in a dedicated dental calculus lab at Leiden University.
The surface of the tooth was lightly brushed with a sterile, disposable toothbrush
to get rid of surface contaminants. A sterile dental curette was then used to
scrape calculus from the tooth onto weighing paper, which was transferred to 1.5 ml
Eppendorf tubes.
All calculus samples were sent to the Department of Forensic Medicine at Aarhus University
for ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS)
analysis.

### UHPLC-MS/MS

The list of targeted compounds included both naturally occurring compounds known
to have been used in the past, as well as synthetic modern drugs that did not exist
at the time (e.g. Fentanyl, MDMA, Amphetamine). These were part of the toxicology
screening for the original method [@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021],
developed on cadavers. In our study they serve as an authentication step, as their
presence in archaeological samples could only be the result of contamination.

Briefly, samples of dental calculus were washed three times each with one mL of
methanol (MeOH), to remove surface contaminants. The wash solutions were collected
separately. The solvent was
evaporated and the residues were dissolved in 50 µL 30% MeOH.
The washed calculus was homogenized in presence of 0.5 M citric acid using a lysing
tube with stainless steel beads. Following one hour of incubation the dissolution
extract was cleaned by weak and strong cation-exchange. After evaporation of the
elution solvent the residue was dissolved in 50 µL 30% MeOH.
The final extracts obtained from washing and dissolution of the dental calculus were
analysed by UHPLC-MS/MS using a reversed-phase biphenyl column for chromatography.
To obtain quantitative results, isotope dilution was applied.
For more details about the method and validation, see the original study by
Sørensen and colleagues [-@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021].

### Statistical analysis

All compounds and pathological conditions/lesions were converted to a presence/absence
score. Pearson product-moment correlation was applied to the
dichotomised pathological lesions (point-biserial correlation),
compound concentrations, calculus indices, and caries ratios to explore relationships
paired continuous-continuous variables and paired continuous-binary variables.
Compound concentrations were then dichotomised to presence/absence, and
the caries ratio and calculus index for each individual were converted to an
ordinal score from 0 to 4 by using quartiles. Polychoric correlation was applied
to the paired dichotomous variables and dichotomous-ordinal variables.
<!--Median periodontal scores were calculated for each individual. -->

All statistical analysis was conducted in R version 4.4.0 (2024-04-24 ucrt),
Puppy Cup, [@Rbase]. Data wrangling was conducted with the **tidyverse**
[@tidyverse2019] and visualisations were created using **ggplot2** [@ggplot2].
Polychoric correlations were calculated with the **psych** package [@Rpsych].




## Results

<!-- detected compounds -->
Multiple compounds were detected in the dental calculus samples. Compounds detected
at a lower concentration than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) were considered
not present. Not all the compounds detected in the first batch could be replicated
in the second batch (@tbl-compound-detect).

The pattern we expect to see in authentic compounds representing compounds
trapped within the dental calculus, 
is a reduction in the quantity from wash 1 to wash 3 as potential surface contaminants
are washed off, and then a
spike in the final extraction when entrapped compounds are released and detected.

Most plots show a large increase in extracted mass of a compound between the
calculus wash extracts (wash 1-3) and the dissolved calculus (calc). Most samples
containing theophylline and caffeine had the largest quantity of the compound
extracted from the first wash, then decreasing in washes 2 and 3. There is
an increase between wash 3 and the dissolved calculus in all samples.
The patterns are consistent across batches 1 and 2.
Nicotine and cotinine have the same relative quantities in the samples, i.e., the
sample with the highest extracted quantity of nicotine also had the highest extracted
quantity of cotinine (@fig-auth-plot-batch2).

<!-- detection vs. preservation -->
To see if preservation of the skeletal remains had any effect on the detection of
compounds, we compare extracted quantities of compounds to the various levels of
skeletal preservation. Our results from batch 2 suggest that detection of a compound
may be linked to the preservation of the skeleton, with better preservation leading
to increased extraction quantity ([@fig-detection-preservation]A). We also
find a weak positive correlation between the weight of the calculus sample and the
quantity of compound extracted from the calculus ([@fig-detection-preservation]B).

<!-- detection of tobacco as accuracy -->

::: {.cell}

:::

The presence of pipe notch(es) in an individual and concurrent detection of nicotine
and/or cotinine is used as a crude indicator of the accuracy of the method. Only
males were used in accuracy calculations, as pipe notches are ubiquitous in males,
but not in females.
In batch 2, the method was able to detect some form of tobacco in
14
of 25
individuals with a pipe notch
(56.0%).
When also considering correct the absence of a tobacco alkaloid together with the
absence of a pipe notch, the accuracy of the method is
59.3%.
Accuracy in the old adult age category is
100.0%,
but with only 2 individuals.

One individual---an old adult, probable female---was positive
for both nicotine and cotinine, and had no signs of a pipe notch.

### Correlations between detected alkaloids and diseases

For further statistical analyses, only the UHPLC-MS/MS results from batch 2
were used, as batch 1 had multiple compounds that were not detected in batch 2
and may have been contaminated.

## Discussion

<!-- Big summary/important statement for the science -->
In this study we were able to extract and identify multiple alkaloids and salicylic
acid from the
dental calculus of individuals from Middenbeemster, a 19th century Dutch
archaeological site. We applied ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) using a method that was validated by co-occurrence
of drugs and metabolites in dental calculus and blood [@sorensenDrugsCalculus2021].
Here we have shown that the method can also be successfully applied to archaeological
dental calculus.
We extend findings from previous studies on alkaloids in archaeological samples
by detecting multiple different alkaloids in dental calculus, including
nicotine, cotinine, caffeine, theophylline, and salicylic acid. The detection of
these compounds was solidified in a replication analysis on different samples
from the same individuals.
Cocaine and multiple cannabinoids were also detected during the first
analysis, but were not replicated.
We contextualize these findings within the historical and
archaeological evidence for consumption of these drugs and dietary compounds.

<!-- compounds detected with potential sources, and those that were surprisingly missing -->
<!-- nicotine and cotinine: tobacco, obviously...-->
Nicotine and its principal/main metabolite, cotinine, were strongly positively correlated,
both in concentration and presence/absence in individuals (@tbl-pearson and @fig-polycorr).
The detection of nicotine and cotinine is not surprising, as pipe-smoking in the
Beemsterpolder is well-documented in the literature
[@aten400Jaar2012; @boumanBegravenis2017], and visible on the skeletal
remains as pipe notches [@lemmersMiddenbeemster2013].
There is also documented medicinal use of nicotine in the Beemsterpolder,
where a tobacco-smoke enema was used for headaches, respiratory problems, colds,
and drowsiness from around 1780 to 1830 [@aten400Jaar2012].
In our sample, we also detected nicotine and cotinine (replicated)
in an old adult, probable female individual.
In this particular case it is unlikely that the compounds entered the dental
calculus through pipe-smoking, as the individual had no visible pipe notches;
more likely the tobacco entered through an alternate mode of consumption,
secondhand smoke, or the aforementioned tobacco-smoke enema.

<!-- Scientific findings as extension of previous work -->

<!-- strong correlation between nicotine and cotinine concentration is important?
      Could suggest that the incorporation pathway is excretion, not consumption
        - longer time in body than mouth (consumption)
-->

<!-- theophylline and caffeine: anyone fancy a cuppa? -->
Theophylline and caffeine were positively correlated in our samples, though to a
lesser extent than nicotine and cotinine, so we are unable to determine if they
originated from the same source (@tbl-pearson and @fig-polycorr).
Caffeine and theophylline have very similar chemical structures, so we expect
they would experience similar rates of incorporation and degradation, allowing
us to interpret the ratio and correlations between the compounds.
Caffeine is present in coffee, tea, and cocoa beans, with concentrations slightly
higher in coffee
[@stavricVariabilityCaffeine1988; @chinCaffeineContent2008; @bispoSimultaneousDetermination2002; @srdjenovicSimultaneousHPLC2008].
Theophylline is present in both coffee beans and tea leaves, but in negligible
quantities [@stavricVariabilityCaffeine1988]. It is also a primary metabolite of
caffeine produced by the liver. Given the low correlation, there are likely
multiple sources of caffeine and theophylline in the population, with tea and
coffee being the most obvious.  
Tea consumption had become widespread in the Netherlands by 1820, reaching all
parts of society [@nierstraszTeaTrade2015, p.91].
Historically, we also know that both tea and coffee were consumed in the
Beemsterpolder during the 19th century. 'Theegasten' (teatime) was a special
occasion occurring from 15.00-20.00 hours, where tea was served along with the evening
bread [@schuijtemakerTeTheegasten2011]. Many households also owned at least one
coffee pot and tea pot [@boumanBegravenis2017].
Distinguishing between tea, coffee, and chocolate may be possible by also including
theobromine and comparing ratios of the compounds, as theobromine is present in
higher quantities in chocolate compared to caffeine and theophylline
[@stavricVariabilityCaffeine1988; @bispoSimultaneousDetermination2002; @alanonAssessmentFlavanol2016].
However, In addition to oral factors
affecting alkaloid uptake in dental calculus, there is some indication that
theobromine does not preserve well in the archaeological record
[@velskoDentalCalculus2017], and frequent consumption of all three items would
be difficult to parse. Additionally, we do not understand well enough the
effect of the burial on these specific compounds, and the original concentration of
the compounds in plants can be quite variable [@kingCautionaryTales2017].

<!-- salicylic acid: diet, medicine, or environment??? -->
Salicylic acid was found in all but one individual in our sample.
It can be extracted from the bark of willow trees, *Salix alba*, and
has long been used for its
pain-relieving properties [@bruinsmaBijdragenTot1872, p. 119]. It is also present
in many plant-based foods
[@duthieNaturalSalicylates2011; @malakarNaturallyOccurring2017], including
potatoes, which were a staple of the Beemsterpolder diet [@aten400Jaar2012].
The extracted quantity from our samples decreased over the three washes, followed
by a sharp increase in the final calculus extraction, which is what we would expect
to see if the salicylic acid was incorporated during life (@fig-auth-plot-batch2).
It is important to note that, especially with salicylic acid, there is a possibility
for the compound to enter the calculus through contact with the surrounding soil.
Salicylic acid is a very mobile organic acid
[@chenCa2Dependent2001; @badriRegulationFunction2009] and the ubiqutous presence
in our samples may be explained by the compound leching into the dental calculus
from the burial environment.
We can therefore not confidently rule out environmental contamination without
analysing samples from the surrounding soil.

<!-- cannabinoids: oh cool! medicinal? wait, where did they go..? -->
Cannabinoids---specifically THC, THCA-A, THCVA, CBD, CBN---were found in the
first batch, but none were replicated in the second batch. Medicinal use of
cannabinoids has been well-established in Europe since Medieval-times, and it
was also grown in the Netherlands [@bruinsmaBijdragenTot1872].
Administration was most common in the form of concoctions containing various portions
of the cannabis plant for ingestion; not until the late 19th century did it become
recommended to smoke it for more immediate effects [@clarkeCannabisEvolution2013].
Dutch medicinal preparations were used to treat a variety of ailments and symptoms,
including pain, inflammation, various stomach ailments, gout, and joint pains
[@clarkeCannabisEvolution2013].
Because cannabinoids have an affinity for protein-binding, they are less likely
to diffuse from serum to saliva [@coneInterpretationOral2007]. This may make them
difficult to detect in dental calculus unless the cannibinoids were consumed
orally; even then,
the overall instability of some cannabinoids could also limit detection
[@sorensenEffectAntioxidants2018; @lindholstLongTerm2010].
Given the lack of replication, we cannot with security confirm that
cannabis was used by the Beemster population.
 
<!-- opioids: Damn... that would've been awesome -->
Despite many of our sampled individuals having lived during the height of the opium era
in the Netherlands [@machtHistoryOpium1915], none of the targeted opioids
(morphine, codeine, thebaine, papaverine, norcodeine, noscapine)
were detected. 
The absence of opioids could be a result of the people ascribing more to the
"traditional" rather than "scientific" medicine, although laudanum and
another opium containing concoction was part of the "traditional" medicine in
the Netherlands [@leuwProhibitionLegalization1994], including Middenbeemster
[@aten400Jaar2012]. It was also generally
considered a drug of the upper class [@scheltemaOpiumTrade1907], and may have been
more common in urban centers.
The absence could also be attributed to postmortem degradation.
It has been shown that, while morphine is abundant in opium, it
degrades rapidly. Thebaine and papaverine are more resistant to various
ageing processes [@chovanecOpiumMasses2012], however, these were also absent from
our samples.

<!-- authentication -->
<!-- the importance of replication - brief discussion of cocaine -->
The only strictly modern compound (at least in a European context) detected in the sample
was cocaine, which was detected in the first batch of samples. Our sample is
derived from an early--mid 19th century population, and cocaine was isolated in 1860
by Albert Niemann, and entered popular medical
practice in 1884. Coca arrived in Europe as early as 1771, but as botanical
specimens rather than for consumption, and there were also issues importing enough
viable specimens of coca for cocaine extraction
[@mortimerHistoryCoca1901 p. 179; @abucaCocaTrade2019, p.108].
This would have been the first case of coca-leaf-consumption in Europe; however,
we were unable to replicate any of the cocaine results in the second batch.
We suspect that the original detection of cocaine was a result of lab contamination
during analysis.<!--and hope this will serve as a reminder of the importance of replication.-->

<!-- correlations with skeletal indicators -->
We explored the relationship between detected compounds and various skeletal
indicators, such as pathological and dental lesions, preservation, and pipe notches.
We found some evidence to suggest that preservation of the skeleton influences
the recovery of compounds from the dental calculus, with well-preserved skeletons
potentially serving as a better target for sampling.  
We found a positive correlation between CMS and nicotine, which may be
indicative of the impact tobacco smoking had on the respiratory health of the
Beemster inhabitants.
Tobacco smoke may play a significant role in diseases
of the upper respiratory tract, including chronic maxillary sinusitis
[@rehImpactTobacco2012]. Although
the mechanisms by which smoking increases the risk of infections is not fully
understood, solid evidence has been presented linking tobacco smoke to
increased mucosal permeability and impairment of mucociliary clearance
[@arcaviCigaretteSmoking2004]. Such changes, together with an altered immunologic
response, are thought to predispose to the development of chronic maxillary sinusitis
[@slavinDiagnosisManagement2005].  
We also observed a moderate positive correlation between chronic maxillary sinusitis
and caffeine which
contradicts previous research linking chronic coffee consumption with a positive
effect on the respiratory system, suggesting a preventive association between
caffeine intake and pneumonia
[e.g. @alfaroChronicCoffee2018; @kondoAssociationCoffee2021].
However, while the
lower respiratory tract seems to benefit from chronic coffee consumption, it is
possible that elevated caffeine intake impacts mucosal moisture due to its
dehydrating effect [@maughanCaffeineIngestion2003], thereby exposing individuals
to greater risk of sinus infection. 

<!-- Findings' scientific implications -->

<!-- secondary findings-->

The detection of nicotine in dental calculus has previously been presented by
Eerkens and colleagues [-@eerkensDentalCalculus2018] in two individuals from
pre-contact California. They also targeted caffeine, cotinine, and theophylline
in their samples, but were unable to detect any of them. It remains to be seen
whether this is due to differences in methods used, or due to our samples being
more recent.
They also suggest that the choice of tooth for sampling may impact the detection
of certain compounds,
as the incorporation in dental calculus may depend on the mode of consumption.
Tobacco smokers may have more
nicotine present in calculus on incisors, whereas tobacco chewers may have more
on molars [@eerkensDentalCalculus2018].
However, sampling may not be limited to mode of consumption.
The presence of cotinine suggests that the excretion of a compound after being
metabolised in the body is also a source of deposition, and
that deposition of alkaloids in dental calculus can occur both on the way into
the body, i.e. during consumption, and on the way out, i.e. disposal of waste
products via saliva secretion into the mouth.
Especially mucin-rich saliva from the sublingual
and submandibular glands preferentially binds toxins [@doddsHealthBenefits2005],
and since these glands are located closest to the lower incisors, they may be the
most effective target for these studies.
This has yet to be systematically
tested in archaeological dental calculus.
Because we homogenised samples from multiple teeth of an individual, we were unable
to test the effect of oral biogeography.
It is also possible that resident microflora within
biofilms contribute to alkaloid breakdown and that the presence of caffeine and
nicotine metabolites following direct ingestion can be explained by this pathway.
However, the literature on
biofilm biodegradation of alkaloids is limited, and *in vitro* studies have only
found minimal contributions by certain oral bacteria in isolation
[@sunMetabolomicsEvaluation2016; @cogoVitroEvaluation2008]; it is possible that
a larger role is played by oral bacteria within larger, more metabolically active
communities, e.g. biofilms [@takahashiOralMicrobiome2015].

<!-- a summary/importance of the engineering aspect of the work -->

<!-- How it facilitates scientific research -->

<!-- limitations of the platform show which questions would be unanswered -->
Targeting individuals with moderate-to-large calculus deposits likely biased our
sample, as the presence of calculus may increase the
risk of premature death
[@yaussyCalculusSurvivorship2019]. Additionally, periodontal disease (often linked
to the presence of calculus)
is a risk-factor for respiratory diseases, if periodontal and respiratory
pathogens enter the bloodstream
[@azarpazhoohSystematicReview2006; @scannapiecoRoleOral1999; @scannapiecoPotentialAssociations2001].
In our sample, the percentage of chronic maxillary sinusitis
(37.0%)
is lower than in another (more representative) male sample (44.1%)
[@casnaUrbanizationRespiratory2021], and the caries percentage is similarly lower
in our sample (17.6%) than
a more representative sample (22.9%) [@lemmersMiddenbeemster2013].  
We used the presence/absence of a pipe notch and concurrent detection of tobacco
as a crude estimate of the accuracy of the method, which we found to be around
59.3%.
This is a very rough estimate, as the presence of a pipe notch is likely not a
perfect indicator of whether or not someone consumed tobacco.
Dental calculus is also
more transient than for example bone, as it can become dislodged during life,
intentionally or unintentionally, eliminating all trace of the alkaloids consumed
prior to its removal.  
Following burial, compound stability over
time will play a large role, as will microbial degradation of compounds by bacteria
and fungi in soil [@liuNicotinedegradingMicroorganisms2015], as well as
the soil environment, such as temperature, pH, and oxygen availability
[@mackiePreservationMetaproteome2017; @lindholstLongTerm2010].  
Due to this, quantitation of the detected compounds may have limited value in
archaeological samples due to degradation, and will greatly affect our correlations
related to concentration.
The detected quantity of a compound will also depend on the quantity in dental
calculus during life, which is largely controlled by the quantity consumed,
how often the
calculus was disrupted/removed, metabolic breakdown of the compound, and inter-
and intra-individual factors related to stages of biofilm maturation
[@lustmannScanningElectron1976; @velskoMicrobialDifferences2019; @zijngeBiofilmArchitecture2010].
In short, this means it is not really possible to equate the absence of a compound
as evidence for the absence of consumption, which complicates
the interpretation of our results.
We have attempted to minimise errors occurring due to this limitation by including
a relatively large sample of individuals and replicating our analysis. Although,
given the relatively low detection rate seen in tobacco, this remains a major
limitation, and will likely be compounded by increasing antiquity of the samples.

Future studies should explore how sampling from various types of teeth
and their position in the mouth affects the probability of a compound becoming
entrapped in dental calculus.
This may also be related to properties within the oral cavity, as well as chemical
properties of the compounds, which facilitate or reduce the incorporation-potential,
and which incorporation pathways are more likely for a given compound.  
We only targeted drugs that were included in the forensic toxicological
screenings, and therefore only covered a limited number of the potential compounds
that could be of interest for exploring past diets and medicinal treatments. The
list of targeted compounds can be expanded as we discover more potential targets
based on which specific compounds/metabolites are more likely to be incorporated
and preserved in dental calculus.  
There is an increasing interest in using oral fluid as a means of detecting alkaloids
in living
individuals due to the non-invasive nature of the testing compared to blood
and urine sampling [@coneSalivaTesting1993; @valenDetermination212017].
These *in vivo* studies are a valuable
source of method validation and can help determine the feasibility of detecting
certain alkaloids in oral fluid and, subsequently, dental calculus. Archaeologists,
though, will likely be responsible for exploring dental-calculus-specific
incorporation and retention of alkaloids, as well as their long-term preservation
in the burial environment. Finally, following our experience with salicylic acid,
we encourage all future studies to ensure that a control sample is taken from the
soil, either from the soil surrounding the individual, or, ideally, directly from
the skeletal remains. This should preferably happen before cleaning, but there will
often be soil left over in cavities (e.g. nasal cavity, orbit, auditory meatus).

<!-- How it will facilitate the specific topic of research (e.g. archaeology) -->

<!-- rephrase -->
While a major limitation is the uncertainty surrounding whether or not a compound
is actually absent, the power of the method lies
in the ability to detect dietary and other compounds that were incorporated
via multiple
consumption pathways that are not detected by other methods.
Taking
tobacco consumption as an example; while pipe
notches are a useful way to identify tobacco consumption, pipe smoking was not the
only mode of tobacco consumption, with others including chewing, drinking, cigars,
and snuff [@goodmanTobaccoHistory1994, p.67]. Pipe-smoking
was mainly practised by males [@lemmersMiddenbeemster2013; @eerkensDentalCalculus2018],
so methods like the one presented here
are suitable for exploring tobacco consumption in an entire society, rather
than a trivial subset of past populations.<!--admittedly, our sample was just that...-->
Combined with other methods, it can also give us a more complete picture
of dietary patterns and medicinal/recreational plant-use in the past by capturing
multiple possible incorporation pathways of dietary (and other) compounds.



## Conclusions

This preliminary study outlines the benefits of using calculus to target a
variety of compounds that could have been consumed as medicine or diet. 
This method allows us to directly address specific individuals, which can be
especially useful in individuals that are not always well-documented in historic
documentation, such as rural communities, children and women.
We also
show that there are many limitations that will need to be addressed going forward
with this type of analysis, and stress the need for more systematic research on
the consumption of alkaloid-containing items and their subsequent concentration
and preservation in dental calculus,
in addition to how mode of consumption may affect concentrations on different parts
of the dentition.
Another limitation of dental calculus as a medium is the inter- and intra-individual
variability of its formation and the many factors that can influence incorporation
and retention of molecules and particles; however, in the absence
of hair and serum (quite uncommon in archaeology), dental calculus represents
an impressive long-term reservoir of information regarding the consumption of various
alkaloids, whether dietary, medicinal, recreational, or otherwise.
