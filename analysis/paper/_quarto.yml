  Dental calculus is an excellent source of information on the dietary patterns
  of past populations, including consumption of plant-based items. The detection
  of plant-derived residues such as alkaloids and their metabolites in dental
  calculus provides direct evidence of consumption by individuals within a
  population.
  We conducted a study on 41 individuals from Middenbeemster, a 19th century rural
  Dutch archaeological site. Skeletal and dental analysis was performed to explore
  potential relationships between pathological conditions/lesions and the presence
  of alkaloids. We also explored other factors potentially affecting the detection
  of alkaloids, including sample weight and skeletal preservation. Dental calculus
  was sampled and analysed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem
  mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS).
  We were able to detect nicotine, cotinine, caffeine, theophylline, and salicylic
  acid.
  By detecting these compounds we are able to show the consumption of tea and
  coffee and smoking of tobacco on an individual scale, which is also confirmed
  by historic documentation and identification of pipe notches in the dentition.
  Nicotine and/or cotinine was present in 60% of individuals with at least one
  visible pipe notch.
  We find some influence of skeletal preservation on the detection
  of alkaloids and salicylic acid, with higher quantities of compounds extracted
  from well-preserved individuals, and also observe a relationship between weight
  of the calculus sample and raw quantity of the detected compounds, and we were
  able to detect alkaloids in samples as small as 2 mg. We found correlations
  between chronic maxillary sinusitis and the presence of multiple alkaloids.
  We show that there are many limitations that will need to be addressed going
  forward with this type of analysis, and stress the need for more systematic
  research on the consumption of alkaloid-containing items and their subsequent
  concentration and preservation in dental calculus, in addition to how mode of
  consumption may affect concentrations on different parts of the dentition.
  Despite the limitations, this preliminary study illustrates the many benefits
  of using calculus to target a variety of compounds that could have been ingested
  as medicine or diet, or consumed in a different manner. This method allows us
  to directly address specific individuals, which can be especially useful in
  individuals that are not always well-documented in historic documentation,
  such as rural populations, children and women.
